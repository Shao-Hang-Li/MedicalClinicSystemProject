Due to the time constraint, we didn't want to change everything to make these work, but we were thinking about it a lot
on how should we implement these.

- FileWriter class to put all the switch case and file reader inside it, so we can manage it better.
"Divide and Conquer" as you always say.
Since putting the switch case inside the displayInfo() in the Doctor and Patient classes is not optimal at all. It
should be separated.

- This is also related to the above class. We also wanted to create the Receptionist that can access both the Doctor
and the Patient information's, however; it was just too long and complicated, so we decided to remove that part.
But it will be really interesting if done right.

- Create an UNIQUE ID instead of searching by name for the MedicalClinicSystem class. Create a counter and add in all
the unique ID. Unique ID for both the Patient and Doctor.

- Also, we wanted to implement the things we learned in Monday about FileWriter, saving files and append, but we
 already have a working code, so we didn't want to redo everything and change and risk having errors. Although, your
 way of doing is more optimized and will improve the code readability and flexibility by a lot.
